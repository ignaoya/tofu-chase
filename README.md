# Tofu Chase 

### About

Tofu Chase is a very small mini game made for self-learning.
It is programmed in C and uses the raylib library. (raylib.com)

The Makefile is taken directly from the examples folder of the 
raylib source code (https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)
It works for me on Ubuntu 18, with the command
`make src/main PLATFORM=PLATFORM_DESKTOP`

### Art

All art used in this game was created by Emcee Flesher.
